This is how the code works:
First it reads the datasets (if they are in the working directory)
Then merges training and data sets
After that it looks for the mean and std variables in the list
Then it select the variables and gives them a name
After that it encodes the activiy vector and adds as a new column as a factor
Last, it creates the file tdyds.txt using the tapply function
